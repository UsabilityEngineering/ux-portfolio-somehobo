# Gevi Espresso Maker

(Excuse the mess please its dead week)
This is the espresso maker that I know, love, and use on a semi-daily basis, and will be the subject of this usability journal.

Through the lens of someone who had never made espresso or used an espresso machine, the first things I noticed were The central button, the dial
below it, and the large protruding handle before that. All of these things are simply and accurately labeled making it obvious for someone who knows
the basics of how to make a latte. I did not know the basics, so I had to watch a few youtube videos to understand the process.
The basic steps for making a latte are: Make espresso, steam milk, put the two together. I will be evaluating the usability of this machine based off of this.

Above is the thing called the "portafilter", this is where you put the ground coffee beans. The handle of the portafilter suggests to the user a twisting 
motion, however, it doesn't specifically suggest the direction. This isn't a big deal because trial and error take about 1 second and it's quite a memorable movement. Moreover, this machine comes with a tool used for packing down the ground beans which is shaped exactly like the portafilter so it was easy to understand.

Espresso needs water to brew and steamed milk needs water to the steam. This machine gets its water as pictured. I really like this removable water holder feature, inside the lid is a handle that suggests to the user that it is removable. A spring keeps the water from leaking out as well which isn't as obvious to the user.

These machines get quite dirty, especially if you neglect them as long as I have, so modularity is awesome for cleaning. All of the removable pieces have slight cutouts so they can be lifted out, even the milk steamer tip is obvious that it is cleanable by using plastic on metal

The metal element on top of the machine is a heating element, meant to be used as a way to heat up cups before serving. I love this feature on paper, but in reality, the speediness of the espresso machine and the time it takes for a cup to heat up are juxtaposed, so I just use it as storage.

The last thing I will be reviewing on this machine is my least favorite. Turning the machine on is easy with just a click of a button. After doing so the power button lights up while the 'heating' button remains dark, this was confusing to me when I first got this because I would figure that heating meant that it was heating up, but it actually lights up when it's done heating up. The other thing I didn't like about this part of the machine was how you need to hold the power button 3 seconds to turn it off, it took me reading the manual to figure it out, and I'm unsure why they chose to do it this way.
