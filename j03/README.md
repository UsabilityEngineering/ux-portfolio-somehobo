# Gevi Espresso Maker

(Excuse the mess please its dead week)
This is the espresso maker that I know, love, and use on a semi-daily basis, and will be the subject of this usability journal.

Through the lens of someone who had never made espresso or used an espresso machine, the first things I noticed were The central button, the dial
below it, and the large protruding handle before that. All of these things are simply and accurately labeled making it obvious for someone who knows
the basics of how to make a latte. I did not know the basics, so I had to watch a few youtube videos to understand the process.
