# Yamaha Natural Sound AV Reciever HTR-6230

Wow what a mouthful that name is. I recieved this as a hand-me-down from my dad and after lugging it up to Chico my goals were to hook my tv and record player up to it so that I could get sound output through my speakers.

To accomplish this goal had to take a look at all of the buttons and inputs for this machine. There were a lot of confusing ones, for example the second largest buttons, equal to the size of the off/standby button, were labeled scene 1, 2, 3, and 4. I took these to be for the various outputs seeing as they were so central to the interface, but as I clicked through them the red arrow indicating which output I had selected went from DVR to DVD to CD and then DVD again, which was not how I expected the outputs to act. Eventually I came accross a manual online for a similar model and discovered that I could set the output of each scene by holding them, then cycling through with the program arrows. As for all of the other buttons I have still yet to figure out what exactly they do.

My second goal was to hook my tv up to this, as you can see there is two hdmi inputs and one hdmi output, each input had a corresponding name such as "DVD" so I guessed that I plug the hdmi input into whatever corresponding scene output I wanted. I guessed right on this, however, this being a reciever I assumed that the hdmi's sound data would be handled by the reciever, but no nothing, no sound. I ended up routing the hdmi straight to the tv instead and had a pair of speaker cables transmit sound from the tv to the reciever to make it all work.

In the end I was too overwhelmed with options and the 60 page manual to capitolize on all of the features included in this product.
