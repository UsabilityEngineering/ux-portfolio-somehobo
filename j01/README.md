# Hamilton Beach Breakfast Sandwich Maker

![Uploading Sandwich Maker.png…]()

Upon first looking at this machine in the thrift store I didn't even think of how to use it, all I thought was,
"woah I love breakfast sandwiches this is gonna be great", little did I know the journey of learning this simple
contraption I was about to go through. After unwrapping the clear tape that was keeping it from swinging open, this is what I
found...

...Now this doesnt come off as super confusing but I began to ask myself, where does the egg go? Where does the sausage go? Will it fully cook raw meat?
do I need to flip the egg?


After looking up the manual to this thing I found out that it goes first half of english muffin, cheese, raw sausage, then raw egg and on top of that 
would be the other half of the raw egg, then you need to let it cook for 5 minutes.
What came off as weird to me and what held me back from figuring this out is the fact that you place the english muffin on top of the raw egg before cooking.
